## Core Technologies & Algorithms

### Sensing

* BLE sensors (EEG, EMG, heart rate, etc.)
* [Potential integration with Apple AirPods (Conversation Boost)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213286) 
* Code: Python ([BlueZ library](https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez))

### Processing (with brief explanations and links)

* IBM Quantum Computing (Qiskit): [Link to Qiskit documentation]
    * Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT): `qft.py`
    * Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM): `qsvm.py`
    * ... (and so on)

### Machine Learning (with brief explanations and links)

* TensorFlow: [Link to TensorFlow website]
* PyTorch: [Link to PyTorch website]

### Classical Libraries (with brief explanations and links)

* Python: [Link to Python website]
* NumPy: [Link to NumPy website]

  Rendering Markdown in Templates:

    Install Markdown Library: If you haven't already, install a Markdown rendering library like markdown2 or python-markdown.
    Bash

    pip install markdown2

    Templating Engine: Flask typically uses Jinja2 as its templating engine. You'll modify your Jinja2 templates to render Markdown content as HTML.
    Template Code (Example - Jinja2):

Code snippet

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Project SENSE</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    
    {{ content|markdown }}  
    
</body>
</html>

    Python Code (Example - Flask):

Python

from flask import Flask, render_template
import markdown2

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    with open('README.md', 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    return render_template('index.html', title='Project SENSE', content=content)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
